AWS provides a comprehensive set of services and tools for deploying Microsoft Windows-based workloads on its cloud infrastructure. Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Domain Name System (DNS), and Certificate Authority (CA) are core Windows services that provide the foundation for many enterprise-class Microsoft-based solutions, including Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange, and .NET applications.

This Quick Start is for organizations running workloads in the AWS Cloud that require secure, low-latency connectivity to AD DS, DNS, and CA services, while maintaining CMMC compliance.

This Quick Start assumes that youâ€™re already familiar with {partner-product-short-name}, DNS, and CA. For details. See the Microsoft product documentation for details about these services.

This guide focuses on infrastructure configuration topics that require careful consideration when you are planning and deploying AD DS, domain controller instances, DNS services, and CA services in the AWS Cloud. It doesn't cover general Windows Server installation and software configuration tasks. For general software configuration guidance and best practices, see the Microsoft product documentation.
