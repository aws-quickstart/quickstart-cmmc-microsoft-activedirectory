==== Prepare for the deployment

1. Create an S3 bucket to which to upload the solution files.
2. Upload the following directories and all files within the directories:
    - Archives
    - Scripts
    - Templates
3. Create a Key Pair to use with the EC2 instances.
4. If/when changes are made to the index.js file for the GPOPackagesFunction Lambda function, you will need to create a ZIP archive with just that file and name it `GPOPackagesFunction.zip`. You will then need to replace the archive with the same name in the `archives` folder. This will need to be done prior to uploading the file in step 2 above.
