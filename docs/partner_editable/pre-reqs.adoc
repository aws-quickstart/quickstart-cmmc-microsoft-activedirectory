==== Prepare for the deployment

Do the following steps to prepare for the Quick Start deployment:

. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the files.
. If you make changes to the index.js file for the GPOPackagesFunction Lambda function, you must create a .zip archive file named *GPOPackagesFunction.zip*. Be sure it contains only this one file. Next, replace the archive file with the same name in the *archives* folder. 
. Upload the *Archives*, *Scripts*, and *Templates* directories, including all files within those directories.
. Create a key pair to use with the Amazon EC2 instances.
