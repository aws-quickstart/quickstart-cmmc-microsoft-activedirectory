This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who want to deploy an {partner-product-short-name} environment that is ready for compliance with the https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/[Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)]. CMMC certification is typically required of US Department of Defense (DOD) contractors.

NOTE: {compliance-statement}

To comply with governance and security requirements, the Quick Start template uses:

* An AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and AWS Secrets Manager encryption.
* Amazon API Gateway Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) endpoints.
* Local customer-controlled file download sources.
* Implementation of Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGS).
