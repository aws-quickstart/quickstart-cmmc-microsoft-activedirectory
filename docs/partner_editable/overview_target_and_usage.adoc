This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who need to deploy a secure Active Directory environment in the AWS Cloud that is ready for compliance with the https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/[Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)]. CMMC certification is typically required of US Department of Defence (DOD) contractors.

To comply with governance and security requirements, this template utilizes:

* KMS CMK for use with EBS and Secrets Manager encryption
* AWS API FIPS endpoints
* Local customer-controlled file download sources
* Implementation of DISA STIGs
