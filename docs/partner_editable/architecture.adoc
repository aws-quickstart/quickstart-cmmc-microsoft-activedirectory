.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Remote Desktop Gateway in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Two Active Directory domain controllers.
** An offline root Certificate Authority.
** An online subordinate Certificate Authority.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* S3 buckets for Group Policy objects (GPOs), logs, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and setup files.
* AWS Lambda functions to check for and import new GPOs.
* AWS Systems Manager automation to import GPOs and set up both the Active Directory domain and the certificate authority.

[.small]#*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
