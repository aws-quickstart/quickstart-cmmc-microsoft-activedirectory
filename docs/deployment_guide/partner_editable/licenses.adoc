This Quick Start launches the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Microsoft Windows Server 2019 and includes the license for the Windows Server operating system. The AMI is updated on a regular basis with the latest service pack for the operating system, so you don’t have to install any updates. The Windows Server AMI includes two Microsoft Remote Desktop Services licenses. The Windows Server AMI doesn’t require Client Access Licenses (CALs). For details, see https://aws.amazon.com/windows/resources/licensing/[Microsoft Licensing on AWS^].
